awk Exercise 3

Save the following data in a file named teamlist.txt:

Name,Team,First Test, Second Test, Third Test
Tom,Red,5,17,22
Joe,Green,3,14,22
Maria,Blue,6,18,21
Fred,Blue,2,15,23
Carlos,Red,-1,15,24
Phuong,Green,7,19,21
Enrique,Green,3,16,20
Nancy,Red,9,12,24

You may also copy this file to your home directory on the server with this command:

cp ~linux199/cit052/teamlist.txt ~

Write an awk script that will compute the average score for every person in the list, the average score for each test, and the average score for each team. If a score is negative, that means the person missed the test, and the score must not become part of the average.

Print the output to look like the following. In the list by name, the names must be left-justified in a field of size 10 (hint: %-10s in printf), and the averages must be seven characters wide with two digits to the right of the decimal point (%7.2f).

Name       Average
----       -------
Tom          14.67
Joe          13.00
Maria        15.00
Fred         13.33
Carlos       19.50
Phuong       15.67
Enrique      13.00
Nancy        15.00
------------------
Average for Test 1 : 5
Average for Test 2 : 15.75
Average for Test 3 : 22.125
-------------------
Average for Red Team: 16
Average for Green Team: 13.8889
Average for Blue Team: 14.1667

Notes

    Donâ€™t process the first record in the file.
    Your script must use at least one array indexed by number, and at least one array indexed by string. The usage of the arrays must be relevant to the solution.
    Your script must use at least one for loop.
    Your script must not be tied to this specific data. If the numbers change, or if records are added or deleted, your script must still produce the correct results.
